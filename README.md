# FastAPI
## Setup
Make sure to have FastAPI, Pydantic, and Uvicorn.
To do this, you can go to the command line and type the following:

For windows users
```pip install fastapi pydantic uvicorn```
For Mac users
```pip3 install fastapi pydantic uvicorn```

Once you run the file, you can interact with the API by copy + pasting "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" in your browser.

Once you're done, open your code editor and hold CTRL+C (or the keyboard interrupt shortcut for your code editor) to quit the program.
